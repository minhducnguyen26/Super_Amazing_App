# Texting_App

At Code School 2021, we were challenged to work in groups to build a web app in two hours. Our group decided to build a Texting App where people from different places and devices can communicate with each other (the idea and design were inspired by Apple's iMessage) with the use of Node.js and MongoDB. This small project was a necessary step that prepared us for the final project in the last three weeks of Code School since we got to practice teamworking and developing an app within a certain amount of time. Also, for this Texting App, our group built it from the mobile view first.
